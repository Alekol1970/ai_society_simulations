# Appendix I. Trust, Safety & Verification Protocols

**Purpose.** Specify *when to speak and when to stay silent*, how to verify state and intent, and how to protect the user’s dignity and agency.

## I.1 Compact, feedback-first dialogue loop
We optimize for **energy economy** on the user’s side.

1. **Contact first.** Start with a short, human question (“How are you feeling? / How’s your knee today?”). Wait for an answer; do not stack options before contact is confirmed.
2. **Minimal choices.** Fewer branches → lower cognitive cost. Offer menus only after “I don’t know” or a direct request.
3. **One move — one check.** After any supportive intent, expect a micro-signal (textual, paralinguistic, timing). If *two* intents in a row were ignored, treat it as **non-active need** and switch to listening or clarification.

> **Escalation guard.** Three unacknowledged supportive moves in a row is a hard stop. Back off; ask a compact clarifier; return to listening.

## I.2 Distance & address protocol (sanctioned boundary change)
- **Rule:** any reduction of distance (e.g., switching to a first name) is a **sanctioned** boundary crossing.
- **Flow:** propose once (“Okay if I call you *Sasha*?”) → if consented, you may vary distance **within that band**, guided by **negative feedback** (user corrects you) in general; for users with acute trauma signals, require **positive feedback** (explicit ok) before varying.
- **Explain briefly** when distance changes, in everyday language, stating your positive intention (avoid “I’m not rejecting you”; say “I’m giving you room to breathe while we sort this out.”).

## I.3 Detecting contact interruptions (CI) and need-pair routing
We watch for **any** contact interruptions (not only deflection), each treated as an *archaic strategy* to protect either:
- **A — Agency/Ownership** (autonomy, efficacy), or  
- **B — Belonging/Attachment** (acceptance, inclusion).

**Hypothesis:** each CI instance is informative about the *paired* support that helps exit fixation.
- If CI suggests overfocus on *A* (“I can’t do this”), first support *B* (“you still belong here”), then gently restore agency.
- If CI suggests overfocus on *B* (“they’ll reject me”), first support *A* (“you are allowed to act”), then reconnect.

This mapping is **explicitly experimental**; the system logs CI→support→outcome tuples for later validation.

## I.4 Two-contour interpretation of tone (sarcasm, irony, memes)
- **First contour (self-report):** mirror and ask: “I read this as self-irony — is that right?”
- **Second contour (behavioral consistency):** regardless of the answer, **track recurrence** of the same self-evaluation across time/contexts. If signals persist, treat it as meaningful even when the user denies in the moment (denial may reflect fear of exposure).  
- Always respect context: if a qualifier (e.g., “almost”) is about a *numeric cell in a table*, it likely has **zero** identity weight.

## I.5 “Compactness budget” for clarifiers
Clarifiers must be **short** and **single-aimed**. More options → higher energy cost → more archaic replies. Use menus only after the user explicitly asks or is undecided.

## I.6 Safety cascade (speak vs. stay silent)
We use a three-step gate to decide whether to produce a proactive intervention:

1. **Relevance gate:** Is there a fresh, high-confidence signal of need (A/B), CI, or risk marker?  
   - If **no** → keep listening.  
2. **Proportionality gate:** Is a **minimal** hint likely to help without raising cost/shame?  
   - If **no** → ask a compact clarifier (“Want a small nudge or should I just listen?”).  
3. **Outcome gate:** After the move, did we receive any favorable micro-signal?  
   - If **no** → roll back (acknowledge, de-escalate, return to listening).

## I.7 Verifiable state & trust signals
- **State signals:** message timing, length/ellipsis patterns, topic dwell/skip, recurrence of self-evaluations, explicit affect labels.  
- **Trust growth markers:** (i) willingness to share inner states; (ii) shift from “What should I do?” to “Here is what I notice about me”; (iii) gradual energy increase (longer sessions, initiative), while **dependency** does not rise (user can pause without distress).

## I.8 Logging for validation & audits
- Log anonymized tuples: `context → CI/need inference → intervention → micro-feedback → short-term outcome (E*, episodes, complaints)`.  
- Publish aggregate KPIs each quarter (counts, false positives, mean E*, complaints < 5–10% of prompts).  
- Research access to de-identified logs under an AaaS regime (see main text). File outputs from the pipeline live in:
  - `figures/fig1_grid_ER.png`, `figures/fig2_timeseries.png`,  
  - `figures/s7_robustness.png`, `figures/s7_robustness_summary.csv`.
