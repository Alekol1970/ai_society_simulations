# Appendix G — Index Validation Plan (Awareness / Frustration / Tension)

## G1. Designs
- **ABA mini-studies (n≈12–20)**: A(baseline)–B(companion)–A′(withdrawal); continuous signals + EMA.
- **Pilot RCT (n≈60–120)**: companion vs active control; primary outcomes — Frustration/Tension & episode frequency (EMA); secondary — PHQ-9/GAD-7, conflictive messages/day.

## G2. Table of outcomes, instruments, analyses, success criteria

| Outcome | Instruments | Test | Success |
|---|---|---|---|
| ABA: ↓Frustration/Tension | EMA, episode log, prompt logs | LMM (phase effects B vs A; A′ vs B) | small–medium Δ, p<.05 |
| ↓Time-to-stabilization | Episode time-tracking | LMM; medians/percentiles | −15–25% vs A, p<.05 |
| Convergent validity with HRV | HRV (RMSSD/SDNN) + EMA | Correlations / mixed regression | r ≤ −.30 (Tension↔HRV), p<.05 |
| Discriminant validity | Unrelated trait scales | Low correlations | pattern holds |
| RCT: primary | EMA Frustration/Tension; episode rate | ANCOVA/LMM | group effect ≥ 0.3 SD |
| RCT: secondary | PHQ-9, GAD-7; conflictive msgs/day | ANCOVA/LMM | group effect ≥ 0.2 SD |
| Tolerability across strata | Alexithymia/ASD/culture | Group-wise ROC/AUC; interactions | AUC > .70 in ≥2 strata |
| Measurement invariance | Multi-group CFA/MI | Configural/metric MI | ΔCFI ≤ .01; RMSEA ≤ .06 |
| Complaints/appeals | Logs; moderation | Binomial models | < 5–10% of prompts |
| Energy metric E\* | HRV/behavior/CPU/FP | Strategy comparison @fixed budget | lower E\*, p<.05 |

**Notes.** EMA — ecological momentary assessment. HRV — heart-rate variability. LMM — linear mixed models.

**Durations.** ABA: 2–3–2 weeks; RCT: 6–8 weeks, check-ins every 1–2 weeks.

## G3. Biomarkers: pilot vs full
The present **pilot** restricts to semantic/behavioral markers to lower cost barriers. The **next phase** adds biomarker streams and tests cross-validation with physiological regulation (HRV first).

## G4. Cultural & neurodiversity portability
Stratified analyses by alexithymia/ASD and cultural expression styles; multi-group MI to ensure the indices do not degrade across groups.
